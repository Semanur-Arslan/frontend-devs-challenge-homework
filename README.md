This repository includes TypeScript code (call_program.ts) that connects to the Solana blockchain using @solana/web3.js and @project-serum/anchor. It interacts with a specific smart contract defined by its IDL (Interface Description Language) file (counter_idl.ts). The interactions involve basic operations like incrementing, decrementing, and setting values on a counter, as defined by the smart contract's functionality.
